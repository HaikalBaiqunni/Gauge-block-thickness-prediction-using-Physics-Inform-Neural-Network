Gauge block thickness prediction vs temperature over time using Physics Inform Neural Network
This program predicts the thickness of a gauge block that is 3 millimeters thick, taking into account changes in room temperature (with a variance of plus or minus 1 degree) over a period of 300 minutes, with a time variance change of about 30 minutes, using the PINN algorithm in Python. It is known that the thickness of the gauge block will decrease by about 0.2 micrometers for every 0.4 degree change in temperature.
